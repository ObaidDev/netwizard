### EventLoop : 

    -  In this model, an EventLoop is powered by exactly one Thread that never changes,
and tasks (Runnable or Callable) can be submitted directly to EventLoop implementations for immediate or scheduled execution. Depending on the configuration and
the available cores, multiple EventLoops may be created in order to optimize resource
use, and a single EventLoop may be assigned to service multiple Channels.
